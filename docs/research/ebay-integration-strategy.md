## Technical Implementation Strategy

### **API Architecture: Browse API + Partner Network Integration**

**Primary Integration:**
- **eBay Browse API** (replacement for deprecated Finding API)
- **Rate Limits:** 5,000 calls/day default, enhanced limits through Partner Network
- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 with Partner Network credentials

**Data Freshness Reality:**
- **Current Delays:** 5-15 minutes for new listings in Browse API
- **Grail Seeker Adjustment:** Accept 15-30 minute notification window
- **Competitive Advantage:** Still faster than daily/weekly competitor alerts

**Search Capabilities:**
```javascript
// Example Browse API Search for Comics
{
  "q": "Amazing Spider-Man 1 CGC 9.6",
  "category_ids": "259104",  // Comics category
  "filter": "price:[0..5000],conditionIds:{2750}", // CGC condition
  "fieldgroups": "MATCHING_ITEMS,REFINEMENTS",
  "limit": 50
}
```

**Supported Comic-Specific Parameters:**
- ✅ **Title/keyword search** with exact phrase matching
- ✅ **Price range filtering** for maximum budget constraints
- ✅ **CGC/CBCS grade filtering** via condition descriptor IDs
- ✅ **Professional grading company** specification
- ✅ **Buy It Now vs. Auction** format filtering

**Limited/Workaround Required:**
- ❌ **Pedigree collection detection** - Keyword-based pattern matching needed
- ❌ **Signature series precision** - Post-processing required for creator matching
- ❌ **Page quality specifications** - Manual filtering of grading company descriptions

### **Rate Limiting Solutions**

**Current Constraints:**
- **Default:** 5,000 API calls/day
- **Grail Seeker Requirements:** ~2,000 calls/day (500 users × 2 searches × 2 times/day)
- **Growth Requirement:** Enhanced limits through Application Growth Check

**GPAnalysis Scale Insight:**
GPAnalysis manages 175,000+ live listings, suggesting either:
1. **Partner-level bulk API access** beyond standard rate limits
2. **Distributed architecture** across multiple developer accounts
3. **Special data feed arrangements** for high-volume partners

**Recommended Approach:**
1. **Start with standard limits** to validate MVP functionality
2. **Apply for Application Growth Check** once business model proven
3. **Investigate Partner Network enhanced access** based on GPAnalysis model

### **Data Freshness Optimization**

**Browse API Reality:**
- **New listings appear:** 5-15 minutes after posting
- **Listing updates:** Similar 5-15 minute propagation
- **Search result variations:** Some listings missing vs. live eBay search

**Grail Seeker Adaptations:**
1. **Adjust user expectations:** "Notifications within 30 minutes" vs. "2-5 minutes"
2. **Implement intelligent caching:** Reduce API calls while maintaining coverage
3. **Quality over speed:** Focus on notification accuracy vs. immediate alerts

**Competitive Advantage Maintained:**
- **vs. Manual checking:** Users save hours of daily monitoring
- **vs. GoCollect:** Proactive notifications vs. passive price tracking
- **vs. Email alerts:** SMS immediacy vs. next-day email summaries
