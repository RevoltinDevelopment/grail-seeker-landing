## Application Responses

### Primary Business Model
**Q: Describe your business model and how you plan to drive traffic to eBay.**

Grail Seeker operates as a subscription-based discovery service for serious comic collectors. We generate highly qualified traffic for eBay by solving the core pain point collectors face: finding rare books across fragmented marketplaces.

Our users are serious collectors who spend $500-$50,000+ per purchase and have been manually checking eBay and other platforms for hours daily. By providing proactive SMS notifications when their wanted books appear on eBay, we transform this inefficient process into immediate, action-oriented traffic.

The typical user journey generates immediate value for eBay:
1. Collector receives our SMS notification about a book on eBay
2. Collector clicks through within minutes (high intent)
3. Purchase completion rate >60% (vs. eBay average ~20%)
4. Average transaction value $1,500+ (vs. eBay average $50)

This creates a win-win: collectors find their grails faster, eBay gains qualified buyers for high-value transactions.

### Revenue and Monetization
**Q: How do you plan to monetize your service?**

Dual revenue model:
1. **Primary Revenue**: $13/month subscription fees from collectors
2. **Secondary Revenue**: eBay Partner Network affiliate commissions (1-4% of referred sales)

The subscription model ensures sustainable operations while the affiliate commissions align our interests with eBay's success. We estimate $15+ monthly revenue per user, with eBay commissions representing 15-20% of total revenue.

This model incentivizes us to drive successful transactions to eBay rather than just traffic, creating quality over quantity in our referrals.

### Technical Integration
**Q: Describe your technical integration plans with eBay APIs.**

We plan to integrate with the eBay Browse API to provide real-time monitoring of comic book listings. Our system will:

- Query the Browse API every 2-4 hours for each user's search criteria
- Use comic-specific filtering (category 259104, condition descriptors for CGC grades)
- Implement proper rate limiting and retry logic to respect API guidelines
- Process results through collector-specific algorithms (pedigree detection, grade matching)

Current projection: 2,000 API calls/day for 500 users, scaling to 10,000+ calls/day.

We will apply for Application Growth Check as our user base grows beyond the default 5,000 daily call limit.

All API responses will include direct eBay listing links with proper affiliate tracking to ensure eBay receives both traffic and commission revenue from successful transactions.

### User Experience
**Q: What will the user experience look like?**

Clean, professional interface designed for serious collectors:

1. **Setup**: Users specify exact criteria (title, issue, grade, price, advanced options)
2. **Monitoring**: Background system continuously watches eBay and other platforms
3. **Notification**: SMS alerts within 30 minutes of listing detection
4. **Action**: Direct links to eBay listings with full book details
5. **Purchase**: Transaction completed directly on eBay platform

Example notification: "Amazing Spider-Man #1 CGC 9.6 found for $4,500 on eBay - Mile High pedigree [direct link]"

The user experience emphasizes speed and precision - collectors want immediate, accurate information when rare books surface so they can act before other collectors discover the same opportunities.

### Content and Policies
**Q: How will you ensure compliance with eBay policies and provide quality user experience?**

Comprehensive compliance strategy:

**Technical Compliance**:
