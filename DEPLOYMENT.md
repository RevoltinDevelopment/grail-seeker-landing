## Troubleshooting

### Domain Not Working
1. **Check DNS propagation**: Use https://dnschecker.org
2. **Verify Cloudflare settings**: Ensure Proxy is enabled
3. **Check Vercel domain configuration**: Ensure grailseeker.io is added
4. **Wait**: DNS changes can take up to 24 hours

### Forms Not Working
1. **Check Netlify integration**: Forms should auto-detect
2. **Verify form attributes**: Ensure `netlify` attribute is present
3. **Test in incognito mode**: Clear browser cache
4. **Check network tab**: Look for form submission errors

### SSL Issues
1. **Cloudflare SSL mode**: Should be "Full (strict)"
2. **Force HTTPS**: Enable "Always Use HTTPS"
3. **Wait for certificate**: SSL can take 15 minutes to provision

### Performance Issues
1. **Optimize images**: Ensure SVGs are properly compressed
2. **Check Cloudflare caching**: Verify assets are cached
3. **Review JavaScript**: Ensure no console errors
4. **Test on mobile device**: Not just browser developer tools

2. Add tracking code to `index.html` (replace comment in `<head>`)
3. Verify tracking in GA4 Real-time reports
